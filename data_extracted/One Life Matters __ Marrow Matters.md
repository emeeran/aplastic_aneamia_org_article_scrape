## What is Aplastic Anemia?
Aplastic Anemia is a very rare and life-threatening disease in which the bone marrow fails to produce a sufficient quantity of blood cells.

Patients with Aplastic Anemia are sometimes asked if they couldn't just eat more red meat, take iron pills, or do both to overcome their Anemia.

More specifically, the term 'Aplastic Anemia' commonly implies a condition in which the bone marrow has decreased numbers of erythrocytes, granulocytes and platelets cells circulating; the condition is called panhypoplasia. In Aplastic Anemia, panhypoplasia is simutaneously associated with leukopenia, a reduction in the number of white cells in the blood, and thrombocytopenia, a deficiency of platelets in the blood. In contrast, pure RBC aplasia, another rare disorder, involves only the red blood cell line. Aplastic Anemia is more common of the two rare disorders.

Erythrocytes  are red blood cells that contain the pigment hemoglobin, which causes the red color to blood, and transports oxygen and carbon dioxide to and from the tissues. Erythrocytes are typically biconcave discs without a nucleus.

Granulocytes are white blood cells that contains numerous proteins that are responsible for helping the immune system fight off viruses and bacteria. Neutrophils, eosinophils and basophils are three types of granulocytes. Granulocytes have small particles, and form and mature in the bone marrow.

Platelets are also called thrombocytes. Platelets assist in the function of stopping bleeding  by clumping and forming plugs in blood vessel injuries. A lack of platelets causes bleeding into the tissues, bruising, and slow blood clotting after injury. Platelets are colorless blood cells.
## What causes Aplastic Anemia?
About half of all cases of Aplastic Anemia are idiopathic, which means they are caused by an unknown source.

When Aplastic Anemia can be linked to its cause, the more frequent causes are chemicals, such as benzene and arsenic; radiation; drugs, such as antibiotics, NSAIDs, anticonvulsants, acetazolamide, gold salts, penicillamine, quanacrine, and quainine.

The actual mechanism of how chemicals and drugs cause Aplastic Anemia is unknown; however, some studies suggest that the link may be a particular hypersensitivity, which also seems selective, perhaps genetic.
## What are the Symptoms of Aplastic Anemia?
## Fanconi Anemia
## pure red blood cell aplasia
## Why "Aplastic" Anemia?
Aplastic Anemia derives its name from the process of the disease in which the blood stem cells within the bone's marrow cease to function and the cells within follicles within the marrow are replaced by fat cells. As the disease progresses, the bone marrow becomes aplastic, hence its name. Symptoms can go unnoticed until the disease has already progressed to a severe level.
## Symptoms and Signs
## No Tests for Aplastic Anemia
There is no particular test for Aplastic Anemia; rather, it is a diagnosis derived by eliminating all other possibilities for the declining blood cell production.
## bone marrow produces its destruction
Aplastic Anemia results because the bone marrow fails (to do that which it is supposed to do - create blood cells). Oddly enough, the bone marrow is responsible for creating the very cells that attack the marrow. In people with Aplastic Anemia, the bone marrow becomes diseased (see causes) and produces t-cells that trigger the immune system into attacking the bone marrow. So, Aplastic Anemia can also be classified as a type of immune system disorder or disease.
## Aplastic Anemia Lacks Outword Symptoms
Aplastic Anemia can also be considered one of the silent killers, like high cholesterol, because it fails to produce highly-noticable symptoms until it has progressed to one of its more severe stages.

Aplastic Anemia typically presents itself with declining red blood cell counts, but that is not always the first indication.

Victoria had declining B-12 levels, then declining platelet count levels before her red blood cells ever displayed a significant decline. In the early stages of the red blood cells being affect, her red blood cells were enlarged and malformed, which could have  been caused by the low B-12 level. A low B-12 level can produce malformed red blood cells, which can then be depicted on a complete blood count report (called a CBC lab) as an incorrect mean corpuscular volume (MCV) level. As well, she was pregnant at the time that the low B-12 level was discovered. Pregnancy can cause low B-12 levels.

Despite the fact that she received weekly B-12 shots, her B-12 levels didn't hold. When her general practioner saw that her blood cells were malformed, and began blasting, he referred her a hemotologist.

Typically, when there is a blood disorder effected by the bone marrow, and red blood cells are malformed, burst of immature red blood cells are produced by the marrow and injected into the blood stream in response to the body's alert to a need for more red blood cells. To complicate matters more, blasts of cells such as these can indicate a form of cancer in which the blasts are the symptom.
## hellp syndrome
As well, with her being pregnant, these symptoms could have indicated HELLP Syndrome, and in fact were mistaken for HELLP by one of her doctors.  HELLP Syndrome produces like symptoms with declining blood levels, but corrects itself shortly after the baby is born.

At one point, her blood specialist believed that her symptoms were produced by the pregnancy, and that they would correct after the baby was born. The declining blood cell counts held for a short period of time after the baby's birth (likely due to a termendous number of transfusions during childbirth), but again began to decline.

A segment of the medical community believes that HELLP can form into Aplastic Anemia. In Victoria's case, her Aplastic Anemia specialists do not support the theory that her pregnancy caused the Aplastic Anemia.
## declining blood cell counts
Aplastic Anemia presents with declining blood cell counts. Typically, red blood cell counts decline first, but that is not always the case as noted above.

Because declining red blood cell counts rarely cause other effects initially, except for fatigue, headaches and perhaps sore joints, they can be mistaken for other causes, or even as flue-like symptoms. As the blood cell counts continue to decline, brusing may occur more easily. When the white cell counts decline dramatically, infections may start. All of these symptoms can be passed-off for other issues, including a cold or influenza.
## purpura
When the platelet levels decline to nearly critical levels, dermatologic symptoms appear iwth purple dots or spots on the skin called Purpura. These spots are actually blood cells that have burst. Bruising may occur with no cause or minimal pressure on the skin.

Throughout its progression, Aplastic Anemia patients report excessive daily fatigue of a greater magnitude than can be imagined.
## clinically defining aplastic anemia
Aplastic Anemia is classified by its severity: mild, severe, very severe. Severe Aplastic Anemia is defined as follows:
